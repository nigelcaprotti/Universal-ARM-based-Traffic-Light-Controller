# Universal-ARM-based-Traffic-Light-Controller
A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is programmed (using 8-bit mode) to allow a user to select between four modes of traffic operation (urban, rural, and two crosswalk modes) using a four-position dual in-line package (DIP) switch.States of traffic lights are simulated using light-emitting diodes (LEDs), while a seven-segment display is used to simulate a crosswalk countdown. Various other shelf components are also used. Utilizing the STM32’s nested vector interrupt controller (NVIC), low-latency exception and (external) interrupt handling was shown to be a feasible and tractable solution to processing crosswalk requests. While dynamic control was achieved in the context of “mode switching”, further improvements to the posited design could be made in terms of mode switching as well as (SysTick) delays; future work includes using the internal SYSCFG peripheral to implement mode switching and delays as prioritized interrupts.
